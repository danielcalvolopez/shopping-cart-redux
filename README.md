This project is a Redux practice, it's a simulation of a shopping website cart that stores the elements added in Firebase to be able to retrieve the cart when the page is refreshed.

Redux is in charge of showing / hiding the cart, show a notification of success or error when adding elements to the cart, udpate cart, add or remove items, and also retrieve and store the data in Firebase through fetch method.
